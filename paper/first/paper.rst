so and so writes about "Consilience", a knowing of science that is not 
interdisciplinary, but transcends disciplinarity itself. Ultimately it is the
recognition of this that can set humankind free from the tyranny of un- and 
mis-education that leads to things like political gridlock over climate change
policy. Similarly, Gregory Bateson devoted much of his career to a "cybernetic"
understanding how our epistemology could have foretold our current ecological
crisis. While these ideas are inciseful, inspiring, and wise, those of us
"on the ground" are dealing with the minutae of bringing about such big, universal
understanding. There is much to do. This note explores the current problems 
facing the Western Consortium researchers trying to find common ground in order
to do the transformative science that these great thinkers imply is necessary
for the cognitive resolution required to save our species and our planet as we
know it.

One who has not been trained in academic science might imagine that since 
all *hydro*logists study water that they would use common models to predict
the important stuff like how much water will be available for humans and their
livestock to drink and to water their crops. However this is far from the case,
and hydrology, like all academic and medical disciplines, is highly fractured
with ever-more specific problems taken on by researchers working in isolation 
of all but a small subset of colleagues. 

The goal of the WC-WAVE project is to ... (according to proj description)

Ch 5.1 of Fielding's famous PhD Thesis is called "Deriving REST". Derive like
a simpler form of an equation or set of equations, like Maxwell derived his
four foundational and revolutionary set of equations describing the laws of 
classical electromagnetism. There are these times where everything comes
together finally. It may be happening now, and we are part of the convergence,
doing our part to harmonize the models used by members of this consortium.

An important book is The Fourth Paradigm. Although it overlooks some of the 
important philosophical and ethical motivations for consilient studies, it
dreams big as far as interconnectedness of information goes.
